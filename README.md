# Build a Social Network

## Base Goal

User Stories

    🐿️ As a user, I want to sign up and log in securely using Clerk so that I can interact with the app as a user on the site and edit my user profile. ✅
    🐿️ As a user, I want to see an error/not found page (using error.js or not-found.js) if I try to visit a page on the site which doesn’t exist. ✅
    🐿️ As a user, I want an enhanced user experience with modern UI components, such as using a Radix UI Primitive or a similar library, so that the interface is more intuitive and visually appealing. ✅
    🐿️ As a user, I want to create and manage my profile, including adding information like a biography, so that I can personalise my account. ✅
    🐿️ As a user, I want to create my posts to be displayed on my profile page so that I can share and manage my content easily. ✅


Requirements

    🎯 Set up user sign-up and user login using Clerk. ✅
    🎯 Create and display an error/not found page if the user visits a page that doesn’t exist. ✅
    🎯 Use 1 or more Radix UI Primitive component, or something similar (e.g. use of a different component library to enhance UX, not just Tailwind). ✅
    🎯 Enable users to create a user profile, and input profile information (such as a user biography) using a form. Users and user information should be stored in their own table in the database and handled with an appropriate route. ✅
    🎯 Enable users to create posts associated with their Clerk userId. Posts should be displayed on the user’s profile page. ✅


## Stretch Goal

Stretch User Stories

    🐿️ As a user, I want to edit the content of my posts, so that I can correct any spelling mistakes or add content that I forgot. ✅
    🐿️ As a user, I want to delete my posts, so that I can remove duplicated content accidentally posted. ✅
    🐿️ As a user, I want to visit other users’ profiles after seeing their posts on a global timeline so that I can learn more about them and view their other content. ✅
    🐿️ As a user, I want to follow other users so that I can stay updated on their posts and activities. ✅
    🐿️ As a user, I want to like other users’ posts so that I can show appreciation for content I enjoy. ✅
    🐿️ As a user, I want to be prompted to complete my biography if it’s left blank after logging in, ensuring that my profile is complete and informative. ✅
    🐿️ As a user, I want to see an error/not found page (using error.js or not-found.js) if I try to visit another users profile that doesn’t exist, so that I’m informed about the invalid page. ✅

Stretch Requirements

    🏹 Allow users to update their content. You can achieve this either with a dynamic route (“/posts/[id]/edit”) or by creating a modal. ✅
    🏹 Allow users to delete their content. ✅
    🏹 Allow users to view other profiles directly from posts they see on the global timeline, using a dynamic users route (e.g. /user/[userId]). ✅
    🏹 Let users follow each other by establishing a follower and followee relationship between profiles. ✅
    🏹 Enable users to like posts by linking their user_id to the liked_post in a junction table. ✅
    🏹 Ensure that a user’s biography cannot be left blank. If a user logs in without one, prompt them to add this information. ✅
    🏹 Create and display an error/not found page if the user visits another users profile that doesn’t exist. ✅

Could add a following page that shows only the posts of who the user is following.
Styling is quite basic for a social media app and a dark mode option would be nice.
